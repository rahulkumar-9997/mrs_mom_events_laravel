                    <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="900">The event is India's exclusive health pageant for expectant mothers. It emphasises incorporating wellness and educational activities into pregnancy and infant care. These activities range from sustainability teachings and cooking classes to spiritual well-being and free medical screenings. The event also offers personality development workshops and moms’ makeover planning. Its primary objective is to educate parents about pregnancy and child care to ensure optimal outcomes for both mother and child. Together, we can create a world where every mom's voice is heard and cherished. After 5 years of marriage and fertility issues for 3 yrs culminating in IVF treatment of Dr K Shilpi Reddy, at 34 yrs of age, she conceived with twin pregnancy successfully but it landed into preterm labor at 26 weeks and it’s roller coaster outcomes because of the impact of stress and lifestyle. She then decided to change our lifestyle to sustainable healthy lifestyle focusing on organic food and holistic concepts. The health benefits are enormous and very encouraging and she had a spontaneous pregnancy at 38 years of age and a full term uneventful delivery. After the birth of her son Avi in 2016 she decided to bring this change into everyone’s life and teach healthy living to everyone planning pregnancy and pregnant couples. This is the story and the beginning of Mrs Mom – an event aimed at “change for good ”</p>
